# Image Classification with Neural Networks

This repository contains a deep learning project for image classification, implemented in a Google Colab notebook. The project compares two different neural network architectures to classify images from the **CIFAR-10** dataset.

### **Key Features**

* **Model Comparison:** Implements and analyzes the performance of an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on image classification.
* **High Accuracy:** The optimized CNN model achieves approximately **82% accuracy** on the **CIFAR-10** dataset.
* **Dataset:** Utilizes the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which includes 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes.

### **Getting Started**

To get started with this project, you can open the provided notebook directly in Google Colab.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/ayushrajpoot2308/Image-Classification-CIFAR10.git](https://github.com/ayushrajpoot2308/Image-Classification-CIFAR10.git)
cd Image-Classification-CIFAR10
